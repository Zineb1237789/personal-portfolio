# 🌐 Zineb El Aouad – Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with **HTML5** and **CSS3**, showcasing my academic background, skills, and projects.

## 📄 Description

The goal of this project is to provide a clean and responsive portfolio site to present:

- 👩‍🎓 A short introduction about me
- 💼 My academic and personal projects
- 🛠️ My technical skills (languages, frameworks, tools)
- 📩 A contact section for reaching out

Everything is styled using **pure CSS**, with a strong focus on **responsive design**, so the website looks good on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
